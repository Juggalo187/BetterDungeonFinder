Known Bug:
Switch LFG role followed by starting queue in addon, it will cause the wrong display of role in Group UI.
I guess that it skips the time point of updating UI and locked by dungeon searching.
It doesn't matter, the new finder of this addon shows the actual role.


Contant:
This is my first time writing an addon for ESO. I learned a lot from Undaunted Pledge Queuer, Pithka's Achievement Tracker, Circonians TextureIt and try some other ways to get undaunted dungeon and setids related to dungeon.I have tested this addon in en and zh, and guessed the language won't affect its functions. But I can't guarantee that the interface of finder will be neat and beautiful in all languages.
